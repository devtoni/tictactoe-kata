Tic Tac Toe rules:

ok --> X always goes first.

ok --> Players cannot play on a played position

ok --> Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

ok --> One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally

ok --> All nine squares are filled.

ok --> If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
